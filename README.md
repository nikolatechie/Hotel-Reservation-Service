# Hotel-Reservation-Service
Reservation service created using Java Spring Boot as part of the Hotel management system project

Managers can add rooms in the hotel they're managing, they can also cancel reservations etc. Users can reserve rooms, query rooms available in a certain period, leave reviews, see all reviews, see best rated hotels, sort rooms by price etc.
